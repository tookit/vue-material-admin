# Vue Material Admin

## Plan and features
I didn't expected lot of people interesting in this project, and I'm so busy, so I din't have too much time to update the code.
And in fact, I'm a backend developer, and I plan to build a backend REST API to integrated with the admin template.
such as json-scheme-form-builder... and I think the code I wrote is a totally a trash, I plan to refactor them.
~_~


* will create a new template by vue-cli 3.x 
* will remove some useless code because of the vuetify framework updates  
* may add vue-nuxt support
* may add vuex support and sample code
* will refactor the whole code 

## Introduction
